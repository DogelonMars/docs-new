**Rufus Chain** is a Layer 2 (L2) blockchain built using the Arbitrum Nitro tech stack, purpose-built to serve the Dogelon Mars ecosystem. Developed and governed by the [Dogelon DAO](https://dogelondao.org), Rufus is designed to reduce gas costs, increase throughput, and support a thriving GameFi and metaverse environment â€” all while maintaining Ethereum-grade security.

### Why Rufus Chain?

As Dogelon Mars expands from meme origins into a full ecosystem of applications, Rufus Chain was proposed and approved by the Dogelon DAO to serve as the foundation for future growth. It enables:

- **Low-cost DeFi and GameFi** applications
- **Smooth on-chain interactions** for metaverse builders and users
- **Governance autonomy** using the \$ELON token
- **Ethereum-level security** by settling on L1

Unlike building directly on Arbitrum One or Nova, Rufus gives the Dogelon Mars community full control over its network environment, roadmap, and community-driven features.
