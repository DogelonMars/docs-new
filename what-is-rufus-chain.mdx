**Rufus Chain** is a Layer-2 blockchain built using the Arbitrum Nova stack in collaboration with Caldera. It was created to support Dogelon Mars’s evolving ecosystem — from DeFi and GameFi to its AI-powered metaverse — while offering lower fees and scalable infrastructure.

At its core, Rufus Chain is governed by the [**Dogelon DAO**](https://dao.dogelonmars.com/) and uses **\$ELON** as its native currency and gas token. Gas fees are paid in \$ELON and permanently burned with each transaction, reducing the circulating supply.

## Why Rufus Chain?

As Dogelon Mars evolves from its meme origins into a full-featured ecosystem, Rufus Chain was [proposed and approved](https://snapshot.box/#/s:dogelondao.eth/proposal/0xf988aff67d371c72e4d08a6a3784b20d314ab53a9456a149fe2e57d665f7219c) by the Dogelon DAO to serve as the technical foundation for future growth.

Rufus enables:

- 🪐 **An L2 optimized for GameFi and AI-powered virtual worlds**
- 🔥 **Deflationary tokenomics — every transaction burns \$ELON**
- 🔗 **Bridges for seamless movement between Ethereum and Rufus**
- ⚙️ **On-chain governance through the Dogelon DAO**

Unlike deploying directly on Arbitrum One or Nova, Rufus gives Dogelon full control over network fees, token economics, and feature development — fully aligned with the community's vision.
