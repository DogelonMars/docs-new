  <Step title="Connect Your Wallet">
    ![](https://files.catbox.moe/6r6xgl.gif)

    Before you can mint land, make sure your wallet is connected and set to **Rufus Chain**.

    - If you haven't added Rufus Chain yet, just click the **Connect Wallet** button — it will automatically prompt you to add and switch networks.
    - You can use any EVM-compatible wallet (e.g., MetaMask).

    <Info>
      Don’t forget to bridge your \$ELON to Rufus first — [bridge here.](https://rufus.bridge.caldera.xyz/)

  <Step title="Mint Land">
    ![](https://files.catbox.moe/u7nhj1.gif)

    You can mint **up to 100 plots** at a time. Plots are automatically selected based on availability in connected clusters, so your land stays grouped.

    Each plot gives you **69 x 69 units of buildable space** on Mars.

    ### Select Mint Amount

    - Use the **slider** or enter a **custom amount** of plots to mint
    - As you adjust the amount, the panel on the right will update

    ### Choose Your Payment Type

    You can mint land using either **ETH** or **ELON** on Rufus:

    - **Pay with ETH**: You’ll pay the mint cost in ETH; gas is still paid in \$ELON
    - **Burn \$ELON**: You’ll pay the mint cost in \$ELON, which will be permanently burned. Gas fees are also paid in \$ELON

    <Tip>
      Reminder: Rufus Chain uses \$ELON for gas, so be sure your wallet has an extra additional \$ELON for any transaction.
    </Tip>
    ### ✅  Finalize the Mint

    After selecting your payment method, click the **"Pay with ETH"** or **"Burn \$ELON"** button to confirm the mint.
