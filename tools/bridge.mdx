Rufus Chain is a Layer-2 built with Arbitrum Nova and powered by \$ELON. To interact with Rufus dApps or use \$ELON in the metaverse, you'll need to bridge tokens from Ethereum to Rufus using the official bridge.

## Requirements

- **Mainnet Bridge:** Requires Ethereum mainnet ETH for gas
- **Testnet Bridge:** Requires [Sepolia ETH on Arbitrum](https://faucet.quicknode.com/arbitrum/sepolia) and [Testnet \$ELON](https://rufus-sepolia-testnet.hub.caldera.xyz/)
